# Green-Data-Multi-Layer-Perceptron

SUMMARY:
Implements Multi-Layer Perceptron and Sequential Model of Neural Network to predict electrical wind output from inputs of Wind Speed and Wind Direction. Data in .csv format taken from offshore wind buoys from open source data National Data Buoy Center: Station 44065 (NYC Harbor). Current implementation is working towards live retrival of data.

WORK IN PROGRESS (So probably lots of compile-errors, but if you are interested be sure to check out MAIN.py (and download all dependencies!) :)
